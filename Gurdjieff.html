                <p><b>George Ivanovich Gurdjieff</b> (/ˈɡɜːrdʒiɛf/; 1866-1877 – 29 October 1949) was a Russian
                    philosopher,
                    mystic,
                    spiritual teacher, and composer of Armenian and Greek descent, born in Alexandropol, Russian Empire
                    (now Gyumri,
                    Armenia). Gurdjieff taught that most humans do not possess a unified consciousness and thus live
                    their lives
                    in a
                    state of hypnotic "waking sleep", but that it is possible to awaken to a higher state of
                    consciousness and
                    achieve full
                    human potential. Gurdjieff described a method attempting to do so, calling the discipline "The
                    Work"
                    (connoting "work
                    on oneself") or "the System".According to his principles and instructions, Gurdjieff's method
                    for
                    awakening one's
                    consciousness unites the methods of the fakir, monk and yogi, and thus he referred to it as the
                    "Fourth Way".
